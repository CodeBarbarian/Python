Python Password Generator
=

Python Password Generator is a script for creating password lists.

Currently supporting the following:

[1] - Numerical Characters

[2] - Upper case vowels (A-Z)

[3] - Lower case vowels (a-z)

[4] - Combination of 1-3 (A-Za-z0-9)


What comes next?
-

The following feautures will be added:

  [+] - A more flexible configuration most likely a *.conf file

  [+] - A more robust solution for generating passwords (Multithreading?)

  [+] - More options when it comes to passwords generation ( Will add lists for known hashes for table generation )

  [+] - ASCII ART! Bitches love ASCII art! ( I have no idea why I wrote that )

And a lot of other more common features such as approx space calculation and time remaining.
